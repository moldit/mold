mold
===============================================================================

The idea is to use existing standards and to stay out of the way.  To that end,
the master and minion consist of normal scripts that read stdin and write to
stdout and stderr.


Script interface
===============================================================================

All scripts are expected to use the standard input/output file
descriptors plus an optional logging control file descriptor (fd 3):

- ``stdin`` (0): input comes from stdin.  Usually this will be a JSON 
  document.

- ``stdout`` (1): output is written to stdout.  Usually this will be
  a JSON document.

- ``stderr`` (2): errors and debugging are written to stderr.  The script may 
  write to stderr and still be considered successful.  Success is 
  determined solely by the exit code.  Things written to stderr do NOT
  need to be JSON documents.

- ``channel3`` (3): Things written to this channel are passed through to the
  historian.  It is expected that this channel will be used to upload log files,
  indicate steps in a process, label stdin/out/err for each spawned process,
  etc...
  
  A script should not depend on this file descriptor being available.  So
  these two calls should have the same stdout, stderr and exit code given the
  same stdin:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
      /bin/bash some_script
      /bin/bash some_script 3>/dev/null

Scripts must return 0 to indicate success and any other exit code to indicate
failure.


Master
===============================================================================

The master's goal is to direct the configuration of systems by communicating
with minions.

On a master machine, there will be a master directory with a layout similar to
this:

.. code-block:: text

    master/
        logs/
        certs/
        actors/
            prescribe
            choreograph


``prescribe`` script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script accepts a fact document on stdin and produces a list of desired
resources states for the minion identified by the given fact document.


``choreograph`` script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a set of facts, a prescription and the current state of each resource in
the prescription, this script produces a list of steps including:

1. desired resource states
2. one-time resource actions


Minion
===============================================================================

The minion's goal is to configure the system on which he lives.


Ways of configuring a machine through the minion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can send messages over the network:

.. image:: minion-network-flow.svg

You can execute commands directly from the shell (using the same code path as
the network uses)

.. image:: minion-shell-flow.svg



Scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a minion machine, there will be a minion directory with a layout similar to
this:

.. code-block:: text

    minion/
        logs/
        certs/
        facts/
            os
        resources/
            file
            cron
            user
            service


Fact scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The executable scripts in ``minion/facts/`` accept no arguments or stdin.  They
return facts about the system on stdout.

When a minion is asked for the facts of the system, all the scripts in the
``minion/facts/`` directory are run and combined into a single fact document.
For instance, the output of ``minion/facts/foo`` might be:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "cats": 10,
        "dogs": 20,
        "gorillas": "no gorillas"
    }

This would be combined into the single fact document by using the filename 
``foo`` as the key:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "foo": {
            "cats": 10,
            "dogs": 20,
            "gorillas": "no gorillas"
        }
    }

Adding custom facts is as simple as putting an executable file in
``minion/facts/`` that writes a fact document to stdout.


Resource scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The executable scripts in ``minion/resources/`` each define the way a resource
is handled.  They must accept as a first command line argument the action to
be performed for that resource.  For instance, to inspect the state of the
file ``/tmp/foo`` you would do something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo '{"path":"/tmp/foo"}' | minion/resources/file inspect
    {
        "kind": "file",
        "path": "/tmp/foo",
        "exists": false
    }

And to make ``/tmp/foo`` conform to an expected state, you could do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat | minion/resources/file conform
    {
        "path": "/tmp/foo",
        "user": "joe",
        "src": "http://www.example.com/foo.png"
    }
    ^D


Some resources support one-time actions (such as restarting a service).
These are supported by using a custom command-line argument (in place of
``inspect`` or ``conform``).  To restart a service you might do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat | minion/resources/service restart
    {
        "name": "sshd"
    }
    ^D


To add a custom resource, put an executable file in ``minion/resources/`` that
behaves as indicated above.


``channel3`` protocol
===============================================================================

Channel3 is meant for getting all stdin, stdout, stderr and other
logging/debugging information back to the historian.

Things written to the channel are encoded in JSON tuples wrapped in
netstrings.  Each tuple has 3 items:

1. Child process name or ``null`` if the current process
2. Key
3. Data

For instance, if I were indicating to my parent process that I
received stdout from my child process (named ``jim``), I would write this to
the ``log`` fd:

    ::
        
        57:["jim", "stdout", {"line": "This is a line of stdout\n"}],



Data format for various keys
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


``stdout``, ``stdin``, ``stderr``
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "line": {
                "type": "string",
                "required": true,
                "description": "Line of data",
            },
            "encoding": {
                "type": "string",
                "required": false,
                "description": "Encoding of `line`; no encoding if not provided; options include `b64`"
            }
        }
    }

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ('jim', 'stdout', {'line': 'this is a line\n'})

Or for binary data:

.. code-block:: python

    ('joe', 'stderr', {'line': 'AAH/\n', 'encoding': 'base64'})


``spawn``
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "path": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "env": {
                "type": "object"
            },
            "args": {
                "type": "array"
            },
            "user": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "group": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        }
    }


For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ('newchild', 'spawn', {
        'path': '/tmp/foo',
        'env': {
            'FOO': 'something',
            'USER': 'joe',
        },
        'args': ['cat', 'afile'],
        'user': 'joe',
        'group': 'joe',
    })

``exitcode``
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "type": "integer",
    }

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ('newchild', 'exitcode', 3)
