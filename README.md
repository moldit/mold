# mold #

It really grows on you.


# What mold is #

``mold`` is yet another configuration management tool.


Mold has 3 goals:

1. use standards (like stdin, stdout, stderr) and already-made wheels (bash)

2. allow functions to be written in the language best suited to the problem

3. stay out of the way (e.g. provide all raw logging information)
