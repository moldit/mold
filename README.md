# mold #

It really grows on you.


# What mold is #

``mold`` is yet another configuration management tool.


Mold has 3 goals:

1. use standards (like stdin, stdout, stderr and JSON)

2. allow functions to be written in the language best suited to the problem

3. stay out of the way (e.g. provide all raw logging information)


# Quickstart #

Install it (the virtual environment isn't necessary, but is nice):

    virtualenv moldtest
    source moldtest/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade Twisted Jinja2
    git clone https://github.com/iffy/mold.git mold.git
    cd mold.git
    python setup.py install

Create a minion:

    mold create-minion /tmp/minion

Inspect the state of a file:

    echo '{"path": "/tmp/minion"}' | /tmp/minion/resources/file inspect


# Running the tests #

After getting the code (see above):

    trial mold

# Building the docs #

Install ``sphinx``:

    pip install --upgrade sphinx


Build the docs

    cd docs && make html


The Mold Standard is separately maintained in the [moldspec project](https://github.com/iffy/moldspec).
